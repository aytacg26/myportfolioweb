# My Portfolio Website

About me:
Since 2013, I have been studying computer science and programming languages. My programming languages
journey started with C++, then I moved to python and C#. In my university years, I was using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for simple
landing websites and from those years and because of the initial nature of JavaScript, I have never think JS as a programming language
to create something but it was just a language to create interactivity and simple animations on the web. After my first project in 2014, I
realized that JavaScript is more than that and started to study it in more detail. Currently, I am a JavaScript Enthusiast and I love
working on any kind of JavaScript-based library, package, and framework. From Frontend to Backend, I mostly prefer to use and learn
JavaScript-based technologies.

Skills :
JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3, ReactJS, Materialize UI, NextJS, MongoDB, ExpressJS, NodeJS
